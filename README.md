## 🧠 About Me

I'm a full-stack web developer with 5 years of experience, continuously deepening my knowledge across frameworks, tooling, and the inner workings of technologies I already know well. I care about code quality, meaningful architecture, and shipping things that are actually well-built.

For three years, I worked part-time as a web developer at a hospital — building and maintaining an internal patient management system using **SAPUI5** and **SAP HANA**. That role taught me how to develop reliably in structured enterprise environments where things really need to work.

## 📐 What I Work With in Depth

**Python Typing** — I write typed Python as a standard, not an afterthought. Type hints, generics, `Protocol`, `TypeVar`, `dataclasses`, and static analysis with `mypy` / `pyright` are part of my regular workflow.

**TypeScript** — I'm very comfortable with the full type system: utility types, conditional types, mapped types, generics, declaration files, and module augmentation.

**SVG & Frontend Optimization** — I work with SVGs in detail (animations, accessibility, scripting) and take image delivery seriously via the `<picture>` element and responsive formats. For Angular, I use advanced bundle analysis tooling to keep builds lean.

**Debugging** — One of my genuine strengths. Whether it's a tricky backend trace, a JavaScript runtime issue, or a CSS layout problem — I approach it methodically. CSS debugging is something I'm particularly comfortable with.

## ⚙️ Project Setup & Code Quality

I take project scaffolding seriously. A well-configured project saves everyone time.
